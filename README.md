# Fake-images-generation-using-VQ-VAE-and-PixelCNN
Vector Quantization plus auregressive CNN model training for creating fake images of given ones.


In this project, the ISIC 2018 dataset is chosen. Task is to generate realistic skin lesion
images by applying advanced generative modeling techniques like VQ-VAEs and then applying
autoregressive modeling techniques like PixelCNN, LSTM, etc.
